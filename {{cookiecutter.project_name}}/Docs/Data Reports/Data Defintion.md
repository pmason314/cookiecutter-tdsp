# Data and Feature Definitions

This document provides a central hub for the raw data sources, the processed/transformed data, and feature sets. More details of each dataset is provided in the data summary report.

For each data source, an individual report describing the data schema, the meaning of each data field, and other information that is helpful for understanding the data is provided. If the dataset is the output of processing/transforming/feature engineering existing data set(s), the names of the input data sets, and the links to scripts that are used to conduct the operation are also provided.

For each dataset, the links to the sample datasets in the _sample_data_ directory are also provided.

## Raw Data Sources

| Dataset Name | Original Location   | Destination Location  | Data Movement Tools / Scripts | Link to Report |
| ---:| ---: | ---: | ---: | -----: |
| Dataset 1 | Brief description of its orignal location | Brief description of its destination location | [placeholder_script_1.py](link/to/python/script/file/in/Code) | [Dataset 1 Report](link/to/report1)|
| Dataset 2 | Brief description of its orignal location | Brief description of its destination location | [placeholder_script_2.R](link/to/R/script/file/in/Code) | [Dataset 2 Report](link/to/report2)|

* Dataset 1 - [Give a brief summary of the dataset, including how to access the data.  More detailed information should be in the Dataset 1 Report]
* Dataset 2 - [Give a brief summary of the dataset, including how to access the data.  More detailed information should be in the Dataset 2 Report]

## Processed Data

| Processed Dataset Name | Input Dataset(s)   | Data Processing Tools/Scripts | Link to Report |
| ---:| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Processed Dataset 1 | [Dataset 1](link/to/dataset1/report), [Dataset 2](link/to/dataset2/report) | [placeholder_script_3.py](link/to/python/script/file/in/Code) | [Processed Dataset 1 Report](link/to/report1)|

* Processed Dataset 1 - [Give a brief summary of the processed data, including why the data should be processed in this way.  More detailed information should be in the Processed Dataset 1 Report.]
* Processed Dataset 2 - [Give a brief summary of the processed data, including why the data should be processed in this way.  More detailed information should be in the Processed Dataset 2 Report.]

## Feature Sets

| Feature Set Name | Input Dataset(s)   | Feature Engineering Tools/Scripts | Link to Report |
| ---:| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Feature Set 1 | [Dataset 1](link/to/dataset1/report), [Processed Dataset 2](link/to/dataset2/report) | [placeholder_script_5.R](link/to/R/script/file/in/Code) | [Feature Set 1 Report](link/to/report1)|
| Feature Set 2 | [Processed Dataset 2](link/to/dataset2/report) |[placeholder_script_6.sql](link/to/sql/script/file/in/Code) | [Feature Set 2 Report](link/to/report2)|

* Feature Set 1 - [Give a description of the feature set, such as the meaning of each feature.  More detailed information should be in the Feature Set 1 Report.]
* Feature Set 2 - [Give a description of the feature set, such as the meaning of each feature.  More detailed information should be in the Feature Set 2 Report.]
