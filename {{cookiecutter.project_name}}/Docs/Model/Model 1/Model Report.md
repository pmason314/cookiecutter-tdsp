## Model Description

* Models and Parameters

  * Description or images of data flow graph
  * What learner(s) were used?
  * Learner hyper-parameters
  * Git SHA hash and/or tag for version-controlled models

## Results (Model Performance)

* ROC/Lift charts, AUC, R^2, MAPE as appropriate
* Performance graphs for parameters sweeps if applicable

## Model Understanding

* Variable importance and significance

* Insights derived from the model

## Conclusion and Discussions for Next Steps
